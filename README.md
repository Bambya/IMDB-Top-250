# IMDB-Top-250

Movie lists have always interested me. Popular movie lists (of movies they supposedly think are the best) range from mainstream audience lists like IMDB, to more arthouse and less mainstream lists like Letterboxd, the Critics' top 100 list by Sight and Sound and many more. In this project, I have written code in python to extract the IMDB top 250 movies of all time, ranked by users. 

MongoDB is used for storing the dataset in a .json format. This json can be later converted to csv/excel or any different format according to one's needs. You will have to download and install MongoDB and also a GUI of your choice. (Robo 3T is a good option). Mongo Uri and website name https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/ are given in the cfg file.
